# client.toml - ExposeME Client Configuration
# https://github.com/arch7tect/exposeme

# Purpose:
# Expose a local service (e.g. on port 3000) to the internet over HTTPS
# via your team's ExposeME server with valid Let's Encrypt certificates.

# Instructions:
# 1. Save this file in your project folder.
# 2. Edit only the two lines below:
#    - tunnel_id: set a unique name for your tunnel (used in public URL)
#    - local_target: change only the port if your app runs on a different one
# 3. Run the client using Docker:
#    docker run -it --rm -v ./client.toml:/etc/exposeme/client.toml arch7tect/exposeme-client:latest
#
# Your service will be accessible at:
#    https://<tunnel_id>.exposeme.arch7tect.org/

[client]
# Do not change unless told to
server_url = "wss://exposeme.arch7tect.org/tunnel-ws"
auth_token = "uoINplvTSD3z8nOuzcDC5JDq41sf4GGELoLELBymXTY"
auto_reconnect = true
reconnect_delay_secs = 5

# Set a unique name for your tunnel
tunnel_id = "my-tunnel"

# Change only the port if needed (keep host.docker.internal)
local_target = "http://host.docker.internal:3000"
